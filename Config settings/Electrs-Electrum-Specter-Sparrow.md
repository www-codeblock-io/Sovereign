## Specter wallet config settings

#### Specter wallet can only use RPC to connect. Whereas Electrs can use both connection types (RPC or .cookie). So when running just Electrum (via electrs) it's easier to use the .cookie connection type and not have to worry about including RPC username/password settings.

To add Specter to our software stack we have to implement RPC username/password in both the bitcoin.conf and config.yml files. Use the below config settings to use Electrs/Electrum/Specter and Sparrow on the same machine/node.



# Bitcoin.conf
```bash copy
# server=1, this tells Bitcoin to accept JSON-RPC commands 
#(such as ones from EPS). txindex=1 allows any transaction 
#to be looked up by Bitcoin Core, not just your own wallet.
server=1
txindex=1
listen=1

proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
bind=127.0.0.1

datadir=/media/rez/T7 Shield

# only connect to Tor hidden services, not even IPv4/IPv6 nodes
onlynet=onion

# Electrs can use the .cookie setting to connect to Bitcoin Core
# but Specter can not and requires the rpcuser/rpcpassword to be set.
rpcuser=USERNAME
rpcpassword=USERPASSWORD

# If running tor, walletbroadcast=0 prevents the node from 
# rebroadcasting transactions without tor.
walletbroadcast=0

# this allows old style bitcoin wallet to be created for eps 
# using bitcoin-cli createwallet electrumpersonalserver
deprecatedrpc=create_bdb

```

# Electrs config.yaml
```bash copy
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - COPY IT FIRST!
# If you edit this, you will cry a lot during update and will not want to live anymore!

# This is an EXAMPLE of how configuration file should look like.
# Do NOT blindly copy this and expect it to work for you!
# If you don't know what you're doing consider using automated setup or ask an experienced friend.

# This example contains only the most important settings.
# See docs or electrs man page for advanced settings.

# File where bitcoind stores the cookie (if not using RPC USER:PASSWORD in bitcoin.conf
# usually file .cookie in its datadir
#cookie_file = "/media/rez/T7 Shield/.cookie"

# Use the below auth="USER:PASSWORD if you have RPC user/password set/active
# in bitcoin.conf file.
auth="USERNAME:USERPASSWORD"

# The listening RPC address of bitcoind, port is usually 8332
daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8332"

# The listening P2P address of bitcoind, port is usually 8333
daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"

# Directory where the index should be stored. It should have at least 70GB of free space.
db_dir = "/usr/local/bin/electrs/db"

# bitcoin means mainnet. Don't set to anything else unless you're a developer.
network = "bitcoin"

# The address on which electrs should listen. Warning: 0.0.0.0 is probably a bad idea!
# Tunneling is the recommended way to access electrs remotely.
electrum_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50001"

# How much information about internal workings should electrs print. Increase before reporting a bug.
log_filters = "INFO"
